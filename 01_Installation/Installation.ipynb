    "## Guidelines for Writing Python File Names in Visual Studio Code\n",
    "\n",
    "When naming Python files in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), it's generally recommended to follow these guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use lowercase letters**: Python file names conventionally use lowercase letters. This helps maintain consistency and readability across different platforms and operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Separate words with underscores**: If your file name consists of multiple words, it's common to separate them using underscores (_). For example, `my_script.py` or `data_processing.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use meaningful and descriptive names**: Choose a name that accurately reflects the purpose or content of the Python file. This makes it easier for you and others to understand the file's functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **End the file name with \".py\"**: It's important to append the \".py\" extension to the end of the file name to indicate that it's a Python script. For example, `data_analysis.py` or `utils.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Avoid special characters**: Avoid using special characters such as spaces, hyphens, or punctuation marks in the file name. Stick to alphanumeric characters and underscores to ensure compatibility across different systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Avoid using reserved keywords**: Python has a set of reserved keywords that have predefined meanings in the language. It's best to avoid using these keywords as file names to prevent confusion. For example, avoid using names like `if.py`, `while.py`, or `for.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that these guidelines are not strict rules, but rather commonly followed conventions. You have some flexibility in choosing a file name, but adhering to these conventions can make your code more readable and maintainable.\n"
